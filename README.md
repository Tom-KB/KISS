## Security Considerations
Use this library with caution, as overall security depends not only on the backend implementation but also on how you exchange and protect cryptographic keys.

## Features
Here is the list of available backend implementations :  
* LibSodium

## Usage example

You can see usage example in the `main.cpp` for the LibSodium implementation.

## Architecture
Here is a class diagram of the two interfaces of this project :

## Interfaces & Extensibility
There is two interfaces `KeyExchangeInterface` and `SymmetricCipherInterface`.  
You can use these in you program and choose one of the implementation.  

### Example with the LibSodium implementation
```cpp
unique_ptr<KeyExchangeInterface> kX = make_unique<KeyExchangeSodium>();
unique_ptr<SymmetricCipherInterface> symCipher = make_unique<SymmetricCipherSodium>(kX->getSharedSecret());
```
This let you the opportunity to change the backend later.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome.  
Feel free to improve this project by implementing a new backend, updating the existing one, or adding new interfaces if you find them useful.
